Focuswriter is a minimalistic-looking text editor with formatting options hidden out of sight.  
Much more pleasant to write in than a full-fledged word processor with ever-present toolbars and (afaik) no way to *set a background image* - which is my main reason for using this program for writing fiction. I just want a themeable program to display the words I write in a pleasant way.

This is my meagre collection of themes for it.
